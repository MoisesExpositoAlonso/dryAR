  abstract  = "Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model organism for the study of
               fundamental physiological, cellular, and molecular processes. It
               has also greatly advanced our understanding of intraspecific
               genome variation. We present a detailed map of variation in
               1,135 high-quality re-sequenced natural inbred lines
               representing the native Eurasian and North African range and
               recently colonized North America. We identify relict populations
               that continue to inhabit ancestral habitats, primarily in the
               Iberian Peninsula. They have mixed with a lineage that has
               spread to northern latitudes from an unknown glacial refugium
               and is now found in a much broader spectrum of habitats.
               Insights into the history of the species and the fine-scale
               distribution of genetic diversity provide the basis for full
               exploitation of A. thaliana natural variation through
               integration of genomes and epigenomes with molecular and
               non-molecular phenotypes.",

  abstract = "Because earth is currently experiencing unprecedented climate
              change, it is important to predict how species will respond to
              it. However, geographically-explicit predictive studies
              frequently ignore that species are comprised of genetically
              diverse individuals that can vary in their degree of adaptation
              to extreme local environments; properties that will determine the
              species ability to withstand climate change. Because an increase
              in extreme drought events is expected to challenge plant
              communities with global warming, we carried out a greenhouse
              experiment to investigate which genetic variants predict
              surviving an extreme drought event and how those variants are
              distributed across Eurasian Arabidopsis thaliana individuals.
              Genetic variants conferring higher drought survival showed
              signatures of polygenic adaptation, and were more frequently
              found in Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions. Using
              geoenvironmental models, we predicted that Central European
              populations might lag behind in adaptation by the end of the 21st
              century. Further analyses showed that a population decline could
              nevertheless be compensated by natural selection acting
              efficiently over standing variation or by migration of adapted
              individuals from populations at the margins of the species
              distribution. These findings highlight the importance of
              within-species genetic heterogeneity in facilitating an
              evolutionary response to a changing climate.",

                 nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data
                 such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical
                 procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a
                 more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when
                 random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs
                 in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for
                 practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the
                 availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM
                 parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to
                 fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing

  abstract = "Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML)
              estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be
              determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As
              for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in
              an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and
              random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a
              numerical representation of the model from which the profiled
              deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a
              function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate
              criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization
              functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe
              the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled
              deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types
              that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to
              allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to
              write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as
              models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not
              easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",
